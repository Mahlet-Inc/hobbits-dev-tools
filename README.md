# Hobbits Developer Tool Guides and Configuration

This repository is a collection of guides and configurations for setting up a
development environment for hobbits or a related project. These setups are not
required, but hopefully they will help both beginner and experienced developers
optimize their development workflow.

If you have an alternative configuration/workflow, or suggestings for optimizing
one of the setups included here, please feel free to submit a pull request.
